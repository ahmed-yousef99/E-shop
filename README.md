# ecommerce-shop-starter
I worked on an e-commerce project using the Fake Store API, where I followed a tutorial video on YouTube. 

During the project, I encountered some technical challenges and was able to solve some of them independently, while I turned to the internet for solutions to others. This experience was both enjoyable and valuable, 

and I hope this project meets your expectations.
